"""Command-line entry point.

Every operational command routes through here, which is what makes startup have
exactly one shape: resolve the profile, configure logging, bind the run context,
then do the work. A command that built its own settings would be able to run
against a different configuration than the one its log lines claim.

**Output goes to stdout, logs go to stderr.** So ``neurotrade config hash`` can
be piped into another command without log noise, and redirecting logs never
swallows the answer you asked for.

``--profile`` is a global option, so it precedes the subcommand — the same shape
as ``git --no-pager log``::
